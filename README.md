## Description

GoSecure is a powerful cyber security tool written in Golang, designed to provide detailed information about any domain without relying on external APIs. With its interactive web interface, users can easily input a domain name and access a range of functionalities, making it a versatile and fast tool for security analysis.

## Features

GoSecure offers the following functionalities:

1. **Crawler:** Explore and gather information about the website's structure, URLs, and more.

2. **Check Server Status:** Determine the status of the web server and whether it's online or offline.

3. **Cookie Info:** Retrieve details about cookies used by the domain.

4. **DNS Info:** Gather information related to the domain's DNS settings and records.

5. **DNSSEC Info:** Check the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) status for added security.

6. **Header Info:** Obtain header information from HTTP responses, which may reveal potential security vulnerabilities.

7. **HSTS Checker:** Verify if the domain implements HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for enhanced security.

8. **Port Scan:** Perform a port scan on the domain to discover open ports and services.

9. **Server Info:** Retrieve detailed information about the web server hosting the domain.

10. **Sitemap:** Generate and access the sitemap of the domain.

11. **SSL Info:** Check the SSL certificate information and its validity.

12. **Whois Info:** Gather registration details and ownership information for the domain.
